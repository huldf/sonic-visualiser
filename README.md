Sonic Visualiser is a free, open source, cross-platform desktop
application for music audio visualisation, annotation, and analysis.

With Sonic Visualiser you can:

 * Load audio files in various formats (WAV/AIFF, Ogg, Opus, MP3 etc)
   and view their waveforms
 * Look at audio visualisations such as spectrogram views, with
   interactive adjustment of display parameters
 * Annotate audio data by adding labelled time points and defining
   segments, point values and curves
 * Run feature-extraction plugins to calculate annotations
   automatically, using algorithms such as beat trackers, pitch detectors
   and so on (see https://vamp-plugins.org/)
 * Import annotation data from various text formats and MIDI files
 * Play back the original audio with synthesised annotations, taking
   care to synchronise playback with the display position
 * Slow down and speed up playback and loop segments of interest,
   including seamless looping of complex non-contiguous areas
 * Export annotations and audio selections to external files.

Sonic Visualiser can also be controlled remotely using the Open Sound
Control (OSC) protocol (if support is compiled in).
