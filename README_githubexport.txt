Github's auto-generated release tarballs are not supported
==========================================================

The "release" bundles which Github serves through the "Source code"
links at https://github.com/sonic-visualiser/sonic-visualiser/releases
have always been useless - they don't contain most of the code. There
appears to be no way to switch them off, so instead we replace their
contents with this README.

The actual source code release is uploaded by the maintainers, and is
named `sonic-visualiser-(version).tar.gz`.

You can find it elsewhere on the Github releases page, or at
https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/sonic-visualiser/files .
