# NB we do not install portaudio. We don't want to end up including it
# in the bundle, because it comes with a dependency on the JACK
# library which we don't want to bundle and can't assume people will
# have. However, we do install JACK because the Dynamic JACK mechanism
# should ensure we can detect, configure, and use that without
# actually linking against it. We also have Pulse as the default I/O.
